# DeutschMotivation

DeutschMotivation is AR App using this app, the user will be able to scan different German books and know which book is more suitable to learn German fast.

The idea behind this app is to help international students who are willing to learn the German language to boost their career level and learn german culture in an efficient way.
However, there are plenty of online resources and books are available in the market. 

But we did not know how much knowledge we get actually after reading the book.
So DeutschMotivation AR app helps users to quickly get an overview of the German book. 

E-g Using this app users will be able to get a quick overview of the book without reading the
whole book.
